# gp-emulators

This is a collection of some of the python programs surrounding the usage of Gaussian process emulators in Bayesian inverse problems. 

I am planning to include: (Q)MC algorithms, finite element methods, covariance matrices, Gaussian processes, various visualisations. Most of them are based on numpy, scipy and matplotlib. 

Little by little I introduce objects. The code follows the PEP8 style guide.
