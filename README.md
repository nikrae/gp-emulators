# gp-emulators

This is a collection of some of the programs surrounding the usage of Gaussian process emulators in Bayesian inverse problems. 

I am planning to include:
	- MC and QMC algorithms
	- FEM methods
	- Covariance matrices
	- Gaussian process techniques
	- Various visualisations

Most of them are based on numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
