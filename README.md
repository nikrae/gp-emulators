# gp-emulators

This is a collection of some of the python programs surrounding the usage of Gaussian process emulators in Bayesian inverse problems.

I am planning to include: (Q)MC algorithms, finite element methods, covariance matrices, Gaussian processes, various visualisations. Most of them are based on numpy, scipy and matplotlib.

Little by little I refactor the code, mainly introducing objects. I follow the PEP8 style guide-or at least, I try to.
