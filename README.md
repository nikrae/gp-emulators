# gp-emulators

This is a collection of some of the python programs surrounding the usage of Gaussian process emulators in Bayesian inverse problems. 

I am planning to include: (Q)MC algorithms, finite element methods, covariance matrices, Gaussian process techniques, various visualisations.

Most of them are based on numpy, scipy and matplotlib.

Little by little, this will be turn into the C++ version: "gp-emu"
